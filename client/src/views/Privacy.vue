            h3 What A Walk privacy information
            p This Privacy Policy applies when you use What A Walk services.
            p Most activity on What A Walk is public, including your profile information when you created your account and your publications and certain information about your publications like the date. Public groups, people you follow and who follow you are also public although groups can be changed to private at any time.
            p We give you control through your profile data, you choose what to show and when to delete it. You are responsible for your publications and groups you provide through our services, and you should think about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.
            p If you update your profile information, such as by deleting a post, group or deleting your account, we will reflect your updated content on the What A Walk web aplication.
            br
            h3 Information you share with us
            p We require certain information to provide our services to you. For example, you must have an account in order to upload or share content on What A Walk. When you choose to share the information below with us, we collect and use it to operate our services. For example your email, What A Walk username and profile image.
            p By publicly uploading content when you post, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible.
            br
            h3 Contact information
            p We use your contact information, such as your email address, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent fraud and abuse. We also use contact information to enable certain account features, for example, for login verification, and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services.
            p If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.
            br
            h3 Non-Public Communications
            p We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content. For example, you can use private groups to have non-public conversations on our aplication. When you communicate with others by sending or receiving messages in a group private chat, we will store and process your communications and information related to them. When you use features like private groups to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications, even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account, which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.
            br
            h4 You control the information you share with us and in the app.
